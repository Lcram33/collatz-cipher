\begin{abstract}
    A polyalphabetic cipher that derivate a key from Hasse's algorithm. Noise and randomness is added to make cryptanalysis more difficult.
    Works only on text. However, any file can be encrypted by converting binary stream to base64 text. This, however, drastically increases the
    size of the encrypted file.
