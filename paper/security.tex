\subsection{Frenquency analysis}

Each character is swapped to another one with a different indice. This, plus the null chars, defeat frequency analysis, even to figure out which language is used.
\newline
The coincidence rate (calculated with \href{https://github.com/Lcram33/frequency_analysis}{another tool of mine})) looks to tend to 0.01, no matter French or English.
\newline
\newline
It is around :
\begin{itemize}
    \item 0.0778 for French
    \item 0.0762 for German
    \item 0.0738 for Italian
    \item 0.0667 for English
    \item 0.0385 for randomly generated text
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Brute forcing the key}

As seen above, there are $10^{1200}$ possible keys with nbytes = 100. With nbytes = 1,000 it increases to $10^{3368}$.
\newline
Brute forcing is not possible in acceptable time with our present knowledge and computer power.
