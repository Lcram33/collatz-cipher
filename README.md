<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<p align="left">
  A cipher that uses Hasse's algorithm with a given number to substitute characters from a randomly mixed charset.
  See technical part for more details on how it works.
</p>


### Warning !

<img src="images/warning.png" width="90" height="90">

I don't provide any warranty that this cipher is in any way reliable.
<br>
DON'T USE FOR CRITICAL DATA !
<br>
No research was made on it so far. Your welcome to contribute in any way !


### Break me !

In <i>challenge.py</i>, you will find a message encrypted with an unknown key. If you manage to find the original message, it would be a pleasure to know how you did it ! See the contact section.


### Built With

</a>


## Technical part (how it works)

Note : the <b>secrets</b> library is used, a library provided for cryptographic use.


### Key

The key is made of three things :
* A mixed set of chars (randomly swapped) coming from DEFAULT_CHARSET defined in <i>params.py</i>, which the message should limit to (chars not in this set will not be usable in the message !).
* A 'key' field, which is the "seed" that will be used for Hasse's algorithm.
* A split char, that will be used to split the message and noise.
* A set of "null chars", that should NOT be used in the message. More details are provided below.


### Key generation

* The unused chars defined in <i>params.py</i> are splited in 3 : one char is defined as the split char, and the rest is randomly distributed among null chars and charset.
* The 'key' field is filled with secret's function <b>token_hex</b> (actually makes a 2*nbytes long hex number).

### Message encryption

* Noise is added to the begining and the end of the message, using the spliting char as a separator. This is to make each encryption of the message unique (see the section below).
* Hasse's algorithm is applied to generate a sequence (as long as the message) of numbers modulus the size of the charset. If the sequence is too short (compared to the message size), it is repeated.
* Each character i is swapped with the character i + key[i] modulus the size of the charset, except the split char which is not changed. Plus, there are 40% of chance that a null char would be added at each character encoding.
* The enciphered message is encoded in base64 (so that the message can be transmitted via channels that does not support UTF8).

### Message decryption

* The message is decoded from base64 to UTF8.
* Null chars are removed.
* Each character i is swapped with the character i - key[i] (+ the size of the charset, if the result is negative), except the split char which is not changed.
* The noise is removed using the split char.

## Let's do some math

Please contact me if you spot any error !


### Number of possible keys

The number of possible keys is, approximately :

<img src="images/eq1.png">

Where :
* K is the number of possible keys with nbytes, e.g. K100 = fff...f (200 times) - 100...0 (1, and 0 199 times)
* C is the number of chars in the charset (not including the null chars, so this part may be slightly bigger)
* u is the number of unused chars.

With the configuration in test.py :

<img src="images/eq1_1.png">


### Number of possible encrypted message with the message and key

It should be :

<img src="images/eq2.png">

Where C is the number of chars in the default charset.

With the one provided by default :

<img src="images/eq2_1.png">


## Security considerations

<img src="images/shield.png" width="90" height="90">

As said before, no expert have audited my code and concept. I just made this for fun as an amateur. However, here are some security consediration. Again, any correction is welcome !


### Frenquency analysis

Each character is swapped to another one with a different indice. This, plus the null chars, defeat frequency analysis, even to figure out which language is used.

The coincidence rate (calculated with [another tool of mine](https://github.com/Lcram33/frequency_analysis)) looks to tend to 0.01, while it is around :
* 0.0778 for French
* 0.0762 for German
* 0.0738 for Italian
* 0.0667 for English
* 0.0385 for randomly generated text


### Brute forcing the key

As seen above, there are 10^413 possible keys with nbytes = 100. With nbytes = 1,000 it increases to 10^2589.


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.


### Prerequisites

python3 (should come with your favorite distro)
  ```sh
  sudo apt update && sudo apt install python3
  ```


### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/lcram33/collatz-cipher.git
   ```
2. cd into the created folder
   ```sh
   cd collatz-cipher
   ```

3. Start the program
   ```sh
   python3 test.py
   ```


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

A command line program is still in progress. For the moment, the cipher is usable as shown in <i>test.py</i>.


### Other programs in this repo

* <i>seeded_key.py</i> allows to create keys using a random passphrase, allowing an easier key sharing and key recovery.
* <i>secure_pwd_gen_api.py</i> comes from [one of my other projects](https://github.com/Lcram33/strong_password_generator). It can be used to generate passwords and passphrases for cryptographic use.
* <i>test_randomness.py</i> is to test how "randomly" are the shiftings distributed.
