<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<p align="left">
  A polyalphabetic cipher that uses Hasse's algorithm with a huge number to substitute characters from a randomly mixed charset.
  See paper for more details on how it works.
</p>


### Warning !

<img src="images/warning.png" width="90" height="90">

<b>
I do not provide any warranty that this cipher is in any way reliable.
<br>
DO NOT USE WITH CRITICAL DATA !
</b>
<br>
No research was made on it so far. Your welcome to contribute in any way !


### Break me !

In <i>challenge/challenge.py</i>, you will find a message encrypted with an unknown key. If you manage to find the original message, it would be a pleasure to know how you did it ! See the contact section.

Please note however that the charset changed. See <i>challenge/params-challenge.py</i> for more details.


### Built With

## Technical part (how it works)

<i>This part was moved to the unofficial paper. See pdf document in the repo.</i>


## Security considerations

<img src="images/shield.png" width="90" height="90">

As said before, no expert have audited my code and concept. I just made this for fun as an amateur. However, here are some security consediration. Again, any correction or material to add is welcome !

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.


### Prerequisites

python3 (should come with your favorite distro)
  ```sh
  sudo apt update && sudo apt install python3
  ```


### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/lcram33/collatz-cipher.git
   ```
2. cd into the created folder
   ```sh
   cd collatz-cipher
   ```

3. Start the program
   ```sh
   python3 test.py
   ```


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

A command line program is still in progress. For the moment, the cipher is usable as shown in <i>test.py</i>.


### Other programs in this repo

* <i>seeded_key.py</i> allows to create keys using a random passphrase, allowing an easier key sharing and key recovery.
* <i>secure_pwd_gen_api.py</i> comes from [one of my other projects](https://github.com/Lcram33/strong_password_generator). It can be used to generate passwords and passphrases for cryptographic use.
* <i>test_randomness.py</i> is to test how "randomly" are the shiftings distributed.


<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap
<h3>
- üóπ Base program <br>
- ‚òê Command line interface (work in progress)
</h3>

See the [open issues](https://github.com/lcram33/collatz-cipher/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).
